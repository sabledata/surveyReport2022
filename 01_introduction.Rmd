# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Fishery-independent research surveys using longline trap gear have been conducted by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in collaboration with the Canadian Sablefish Association under a collaborative agreement. Survey procedures have evolved over the years  with 1. standardized fishing sets (1988 - 2010) and traditional tagging sets (1991 - 2007) conducted at offshore indexing localities; 2. traditional tagging sets conducted at offshore tagging localities (1995 - 2008); 3. standardized fishing sets conducted at mainland inlet localities (1994 - 2019, 2021, 2022); and 4. stratified random sets conducted within five spatial strata (2003-2022).  

The stratified random survey is used to obtain catch rate data, gather biological samples, capture oceanographic measurements, record gear bottom contact and collect tag release and recapture data. This information is used as the key contemporary index of abundance for assessing the biological status of the Sablefish stock, and to condition an operating model that serves as the biological basis of the coastal Management Strategy Evaluation [@DFO2020]. In 2021 and 2022, the Canadian Sablefish Association supported a multi-year research study with camera equipment to understand and quantify movement of longline trap gear.
